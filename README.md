# tistore

tistore is a simple GUI application for grabbing photos from Tistory blogs. It can grab entire blog, separate post or use a list of URLs and download them in parallel using blazingly fast [aria2](https://github.com/tatsuhiro-t/aria2) backend. Original filenames (including Hangul) are preserved.
